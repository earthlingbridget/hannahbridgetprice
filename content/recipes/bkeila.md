> ### Method
>
> Put the oil in a wide, deep frying or saute pan for which you have a lid, and set it on a medium heat. When hot, add the onion and salt, and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Stir in the garlic and leeks, cover the pan and leave to cook for eight minutes, until the leeks are soft.
> 
> Add the artichokes, butter beans, frozen petits pois and stock to the pan, mix well, then cover again and cook for a further five minutes.
> 
> Add the lemon juice, then chop the herbs and stir them in, too, along with the ground pepper.
> 
> Taste and adjust the seasoning as you wish, then distribute between shallow bowls. Serve with toasted sourdough drizzled with more extra-virgin olive oil on the side.
