When hot, add the onion and salt, and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Stir in the garlic and leeks, cover the pan and leave to cook for eight minutes, until the leeks are soft.

> Taste and adjust the seasoning as you wish, then distribute between shallow bowls. Serve with toasted sourdough drizzled with more extra-virgin olive oil on the side.
