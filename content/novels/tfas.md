In this Babel meets Six of Crows adventure, in a world still suffering the consequences of colonialism, four budding students must overcome their differences and work together to prove themselves at the world’s first, and worst, international university, whilst bringing out both the best and worst in one another.

Most people dream of changing their life. Many people plan how to get there. Few work to do so. Only a handful achieve it.
On a remnant of an empire long gone from the earth, Ornanbys University welcomes those who failed the exams to get anywhere else. Having failed for numerous reasons, four students from across a broken world are forced together, only joined in two things: their resentment for having ended up there, and their desire to prove themselves.
After an assassination attempt, a coup, and a murder, they’ll be forced together and learn more than they bargained for. But will they be a part of the solution for a world on the brink, or will their own selfish desires and fears only doom it further? 

A brutal (international) high fantasy about colonialism, unlikely friendship, and strength in diversity. Featuring friends-to-lovers, found family, high stakes, no clear-cut villain, academia, and a diverse, well defined magic system.
